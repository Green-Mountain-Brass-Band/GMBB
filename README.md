# Green Mountain Brass Band Website
The primary website for the Green Mountain Brass Band. This site includes resources and links to information regarding the band.

The site can be accessed and viewed [here](https://green-mountain-brass-band.github.io/GMBB).

## Roadmap
The current focus of the project is to get the main components of the site completed.
- Homepage
- About Page

Header and footer elements might not be added, depending on the purpose they would serve given the size of the site.

---

While the core of the site is being completed, content can be added to the organization's primary google account
for quick embedding.
- Google Calendar Integration
- Google Photo Integration
